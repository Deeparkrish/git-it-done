## Technologies
   *  HTML
   *  CSS
   *  Java script
   *  HTML DOMs
   *  Server side APIs


## Process
 A pre-existing code was analyzed.
 The goal was accomplished by dividing the entire problem into modules in the following way:
        1. Search repos by username:
          - Users can enter a GitHub username and see a list of all repos from that account.
          - Repos with no open issues will display a checkmark.
          - Repos with open issues will display an X with the number of issues or pull requests.
        2. See list of all open issues
          - Users can click on a repository name, which will route them to a new page.
          - The second HTML page will display a list of all open issues for that repository.
        3. Search for featured repos
            - Users can click on a language button to see a list of featured repos that use that language.
              Examples: HTML, CSS, JavaScript. 
            - The list of featured repos will look exactly like the list of user repos.
